**GodotKit** is a Python library providing functions and classes for the automation of tasks related to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) releases and projects.

It was originally developed to power [GoGo](https://github.com/krosseye/gogo), but is a standalone package that can be used in any Python project requiring programmatic interaction with Godot files and versions.
